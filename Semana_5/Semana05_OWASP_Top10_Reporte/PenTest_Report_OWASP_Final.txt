1. Executive Summary
A comprehensive Penetration Test was conducted on the target web application to assess its security posture against the critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Our most significant finding was Remote Code Execution (RCE). This security failure, achieved through Insecure Deserialization and the use of Vulnerable Components (Nostromo 1.9.6), allowed our team to gain full control of the server.

The combination of critical vulnerabilities and deficient monitoring exposes the organization to a security risk classified as Critical. Immediate corrective action is required.

2. Detailed Findings (Technical Section)
A. Code Execution and Access Control Failures
OWASP Vulnerability	Verified Impact	Mitigation Recommendation
A08: Insecure Deserialization	A reverse shell was injected via the encodedPayload cookie, leading to full machine control.	Prohibit the deserialization of data from untrusted sources (like cookies). If necessary, use secure formats (JSON) and avoid Python Pickle.
A06: Vulnerable Components	RCE was verified by exploiting the Nostromo 1.9.6 server. Evidence: The wc -c /etc/passwd command returned 1661 characters.	Immediately update the web server or migrate to a supported alternative. Establish a rigorous patch management policy.
A01: Broken Access Control	Privileges were escalated from a standard user to admin by altering the userType cookie without server-side validation.	Implement strict server-side validation for every privileged request, ensuring the user has the necessary permissions before execution.
B. Authentication and Monitoring Failures
OWASP Vulnerability	Verified Impact	Mitigation Recommendation
A07: Identification and Authentication Failures	Log analysis revealed a Brute Force Attack from IP 49.99.13.16 against the /login endpoint.	Implement rate-limiting on the login endpoint and account lockout after 3-5 failed attempts.
A10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring	IP 10.0.2.1 was detected attempting to inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.	Enhance monitoring using a SIEM system to automatically detect attack patterns. Apply Output Encoding to neutralize user data before rendering it in the UI.
3. Conclusion and Prioritized Recommendations
Conclusion: Failures in application development and infrastructure management (outdated components) allowed for complete system compromise.

Priority Recommendation: Mitigation of RCE (A06 and A08) must be the immediate priority to eliminate the risk of total data breach and system compromise.
