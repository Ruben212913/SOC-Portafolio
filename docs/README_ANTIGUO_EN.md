Cybersecurity Operations (SOC) Portfolio - Ruben Rodriguez Roman
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Operations (SOC) Portfolio! This repository showcases practical projects, vulnerability reports, and adversary emulation exercises, demonstrating my growing skills and hands-on experience in the cybersecurity field.

I'm actively learning and applying concepts in network security, vulnerability management, and incident response, striving to contribute effectively to a Security Operations Center environment.

Projects & Reports
Here's an overview of the key projects and reports housed within this portfolio, organized by week:

Week 1: Foundational Labs
This section contains my initial hands-on exercises, covering foundational cybersecurity and networking concepts. It includes:

üîç Apache Log Analysis: Practical exercises focused on interpreting and analyzing Apache web server logs to identify security events.

üêß Practical Linux Exercises (Bandit): Notes and solutions from the Bandit Wargame, enhancing my command-line proficiency and understanding of Linux fundamentals.

Location: Semana1/

Week 2: Security Tooling & Network Analysis
This section focuses on using standard security tools for network analysis and auditing. Projects include:

üåê Nmap Port Analysis: Reports on scanning and analyzing open ports on target systems to identify potential entry points.

üîì John the Ripper Password Auditing: Exercises in using John the Ripper to audit password security and identify weak credentials.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wireshark HTTP Capture Analysis: Practical labs on capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic with Wireshark to understand unencrypted data transmission.

üìà Splunk DNS Log Analysis: A project on ingesting and analyzing DNS logs in Splunk to detect suspicious or malicious network activity.

Location: Semana2/

Week 3: Malware Analysis & Vulnerability Management
This section showcases hands-on experience in dynamic malware analysis and vulnerability assessment. Projects include:

üî¨ Malware Triage & Memory Forensics: A detailed report on a malware analysis and triage exercise, utilizing Volatility Framework to perform memory forensics and extract indicators of compromise (IOCs).

üö® Nessus Vulnerability Assessment Reports: A comprehensive report on a critical vulnerability in Node.js identified with Tenable Nessus Essentials. The report details the vulnerability's nature, its potential impact, and the recommended solutions to mitigate the risk.

Threat Emulation Report - Red Team Atomic (Compensatory Project)
This section documents a comprehensive threat emulation exercise. Conducted as a compensatory project for an advanced cybersecurity course, its primary goal was to simulate specific adversary tactics using Atomic Red Team frameworks and then perform threat hunting to detect evidence of these activities within a Windows environment.

Project Focus:
This project delves into the practical application of MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ tactics, specifically:

TA0001 - Initial Access: Exploring methods an adversary might use to gain initial entry into a system.

T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Simulating the execution of commands and scripts by an attacker for various malicious purposes.

T1566 - Phishing: Emulating a phishing attempt as a common initial access vector to compromise user credentials or trigger malware execution.

The project also features a threat hunting component, utilizing PowerShell for active querying and Windows Event Viewer (Event Logs) for forensic analysis to search for indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Project Location: threat-emulation-report/
