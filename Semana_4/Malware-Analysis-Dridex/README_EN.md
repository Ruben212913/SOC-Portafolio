# Malware Behavior Report: Dridex (Week 4 - Day 24)

## Introduction
This report summarizes the behavioral analysis of a known Dridex banking Trojan sample. The analysis was conducted using the **Hybrid Analysis (Falcon Sandbox)** platform, which provided detailed MITRE ATT&CK mapping of the malicious activity.

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Malware Name** | Dridex (Banking Trojan) |
| **Hash SHA-256** | 178ba564b39bd07577e974a9b677dfd86ffa1f1d0299dfd958eb883c5ef6c3e1 |
| **Analysis Platform** | Hybrid Analysis (Falcon Sandbox) |
| **Threat Score** | 100/100 (Malicious) |

## Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

The following techniques were observed, directly supporting the malware's goals of persistence, evasion, and credential theft:

| Tactic | Technique (ATT&CK ID) | Summary of Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Defense Evasion** | T1055: Process Injection | Allocates virtual memory in a self process to prepare for code injection and evade host defenses. |
| **Credential Access / Persistence** | T1056.004: Credential API Hooking | Installs hooks/patches the running process, a common method to intercept credentials (keylogging). |
| **Command and Control** | T1071: Application Layer Protocol | Found potential URLs in binary/memory, indicating communication with a remote C2 server. |
| **Discovery** | T1082: System Information Discovery | Reads the active computer name and system configuration to profile the victim's environment. |

## Conclusion
The analysis confirmed that the Dridex sample is a severe threat, executing advanced **Defense Evasion** techniques (Process Injection) while attempting to establish **Command and Control** and perform **Credential Access** via API hooking. The high Threat Score warrants immediate action to block the associated C2 infrastructure (if available) and hunt for similar processes.
