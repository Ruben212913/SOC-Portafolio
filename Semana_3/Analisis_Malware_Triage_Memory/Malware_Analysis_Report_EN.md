Malware Analysis Report: UWKpjFjDzM.exe
Introduction
This report details the dynamic analysis of a malicious executable, identified as UWKpjFjDzM.exe, within an isolated virtual machine (Windows 10).

Initial Identification
File Name: UWKpjFjDzM.exe

SHA256 Hash: [SHA256 hash of the file, if available, otherwise "Not available in this report"].

Disguise: The malware presented with fake metadata, impersonating an "ApacheBench command line utility" from the "Apache Software Foundation" (Version 2.2.14).

Dynamic Analysis Methodology
The analysis was conducted in a Windows 10 virtual machine, completely isolated from the network. The following tools were used:

Process Monitor (Procmon): To monitor file system and registry activity.

Process Explorer: To monitor processes and their modules.

Windows Defender: Temporarily disabled to allow the malware to execute.

Observed Behavior
Silent Execution and Self-Deletion: Upon execution, the malware showed no user interface. Immediately after its launch, the UWKpjFjDzM.exe file self-deleted from the desktop.

Preparation for Network Activity: Process Monitor showed that the malware accessed C:\Windows\SysWOW64\mswsock.dll and loaded ws2_32.dll. This indicates its intent to perform network operations.

In-Memory Code Injection (Fileless Technique):

A CreateFileMapping operation was observed on mswsock.dll with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions. This is strong evidence that the malware prepared a memory space within a legitimate process (or its own process) to inject and execute malicious code.

This behavior suggests the use of a "fileless" technique, where the malicious code resides and executes in memory, rather than being in a persistent file on disk.

Persistence Attempt: Process Monitor logged a RegQueryKey operation on HKLM. This indicates that the malware explored the Windows Registry, likely searching for or preparing a location to establish a persistence mechanism (to ensure it runs on future system boots).

Conclusions
UWKpjFjDzM.exe is a stealthy malware that employs evasive techniques:

Fake Identity: It disguises itself as a legitimate tool to evade initial detection.

Volatile Execution: It self-deletes from the disk to hinder forensic analysis.

In-Memory Operation: It primarily operates in memory (fileless) to avoid file-based detection.

Network Capability: It is designed to establish network communications, possibly for data exfiltration or to download additional payloads.

Persistence Mechanism: It attempts to establish a persistence point in the Registry to ensure its continued execution.

Recommendations
Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions capable of detecting code injection techniques and fileless malware.

Monitor Windows Registry activity to detect suspicious changes in startup keys.

Educate users about the dangers of executing files from unknown sources.

Deploy a robust next-generation antivirus solution with behavioral analysis capabilities.
