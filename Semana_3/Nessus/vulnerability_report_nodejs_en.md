### **Vulnerability Report - Outdated Node.js Version**

**Scan Date:** July 4, 2025
**Scanning Tool:** Tenable Nessus Essentials 10.9.x
**Scanned Target:** Kali Linux Virtual Machine (IP: 10.0.2.15)

#### **1. Vulnerability Summary**

* **Vulnerability Name:** Vulnerable Node.js Version.
* **Severity:** Critical (Red)
* **Associated CVE (if applicable):** Nessus description indicates "multiple vulnerabilities" referenced in the "Wednesday February 14 2024 Security Releases advisory" from Node.js. This suggests that several specific CVEs are covered by this general security update.

#### **2. Description and Context**

This vulnerability was detected in **Node.js version 20.11.0** installed on the Kali Linux machine. Nessus identified that this version is older than versions 18.19.1, 20.11.1, and 21.6.2. The installed version is affected by multiple known security flaws documented in the Node.js security advisory of February 14, 2024. The specific path where the component was found is `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/playwright/driver/node`.

#### **3. Potential Impact**

Vulnerabilities in Node.js can vary in severity and type, but often include risks such as:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause the service or application using Node.js to stop functioning.
* **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
* **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain higher permissions on the system.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could seriously compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.

#### **4. Remediation Recommendations**

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following action is recommended:

* **Update Node.js:** Update the Node.js installation to **version 20.11.1 or later**. Consideration can also be given to updating to 18.19.1 or 21.6.2, depending on the development branch preferred. The update can be performed via Kali's package manager (APT) or by following Node.js's official guides for specific version updates. An initial command in Kali could be:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade nodejs
    ```
    (Note: For Node.js, tools like `nvm` or Node.js's own package manager are often used for finer updates, but `apt upgrade` will attempt to get the latest version available in Kali's repositories).

#### **5. Verification**

After applying the remediation, a new Nessus scan should be performed on IP 10.0.2.15 to confirm that the Node.js vulnerability is no longer detected, thus validating the effectiveness of the solution.
