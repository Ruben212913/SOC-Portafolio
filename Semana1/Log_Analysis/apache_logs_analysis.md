# Apache Log Analysis Report

This report summarizes the findings from analyzing Apache web server access logs for common attack patterns and suspicious activity.

## Findings
- **Suspicious IPs**:
  - **66.249.73.135** (482 requests)
  - **46.105.14.53** (364 requests)
  - **130.237.218.86** (357 requests)
  *(Listing the top 3 IPs by request count)*

- **Detected Attack Patterns**:
  - **0 attempts** to `/phpmyadmin` (No attempts to access phpMyAdmin were found.)
  - **12 attempts** to `/wp-login.php` (Multiple attempts to access the WordPress login page were observed, indicating vulnerability scanning or brute-force attempts.)
  - **0 attempts** of SQL Injection (No patterns indicative of SQL injection, such as `union select`, `sleep()`, or `benchmark()`, were detected.)

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed significant scanning activity, particularly targeting WordPress login pages, and a high volume of requests from a few specific IP addresses. While no direct SQL injection attempts were identified, the scanning activity highlights the need for robust web application security measures and continuous log monitoring.
